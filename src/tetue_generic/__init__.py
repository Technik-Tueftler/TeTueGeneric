"""
This module initializes the package and provides central variables and configurations.
- Defines generic standard variables that can be used throughout the package.
- Imports variables from the parent module if they are already defined to avoid redundancy.
- Enables centralized management and reusability of shared resources.

Note:
- Parent variables are only imported if they are explicitly defined in the parent module.
- Variables from higher-level take precedence.
